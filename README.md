This repository serves as the support material for the "Introduction to python" workshop session conducted yearly by Roumieh's Advanced Software Society. This session aims to provide an introduction to the python programming language from the point of view of someone with a little experience already in other programming languages (in our case usually it is  C/C++.)

## The "workshop code" Jupyter notebook 
This was the main support for all explanations and code examples during the workshop and this is the part to be reviewed for reference for all those who attended as well as those who did not attend.
# For those new to Github
